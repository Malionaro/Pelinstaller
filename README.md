# Pelinstaller

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Malionaro/Pelinstaller)](LICENSE.md)

## Installation

1) To get started, it's important to ensure that your machine is freshly reinstalled if you've made any changes to it beforehand.
2) Point a DNS A-Record to your machine's IP address, like panel.example.com to 192.168.53.72.
3) To download and run the installer, simply enter the following command into your terminal and follow the prompts:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malionaro/Pelinstaller/Production/install.sh || wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malionaro/Pelinstaller/Production/install.sh)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

⚠️ Troubleshooting: If you encounter any issues during installation or while using Pelican, first check the Pelican logs and review the official [Pelican Troubleshooting Guide](https://pelican.dev/docs/troubleshooting/). If you're still unable to resolve the problem, please open an issue on the [PelInstaller GitHub repository](https://github.com/Malionaro/Pelinstaller) and share any relevant logs.

Here is a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8UJhyUFoHM) that illustrates the installation process.

_\* Indicates an operating system and release that previously was supported by this script._

## Firewall setup

The installation scripts can install and configure a firewall for you. The script will ask whether you want this or not. It is highly recommended to opt-in for the automatic firewall setup.

## Production & Ops

### Creating a release

In `install.sh` github source and script release variables should change every release. Firstly, update the `CHANGELOG.md` so that the release date and release tag are both displayed. No changes should be made to the changelog points themselves. Secondly, update `GITHUB_SOURCE` and `SCRIPT_RELEASE` in `install.sh`. Finally, you can now push a commit with the message `Release vX.Y.Z`. Create a release on GitHub. See [this commit](https://github.com/Zinidia/Pelinstaller/commit/90aaae10785f1032fdf90b216a4a8d8ca64e6d44) for reference.
